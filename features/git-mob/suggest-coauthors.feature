Feature: Suggest co-authors from commit history

  Background: 
    Given I have installed git-mob into "local_bin" within the current directory
    And I look for executables in "local_bin" within the current directory
    Given I run `git config --global user.name "Jane Doe"`
    And I run `git config --global user.email "jane@example.com"`
    And a file named "~/.git-coauthors" with:
      """
      {
        "coauthors": {
          "ad": {
            "name": "Amy Doe",
            "email": "amy@findmypast.com"
          },
          "bd": {
            "name": "Bob Doe",
            "email": "bob@findmypast.com"
          }
        }
      }
      """
    And a simple git repo at "example" with the following empty commits:
      | Name     | Email              | Commit_Message       |
      | Amy Doe  | amy@findmypast.com | Amy's empty commit   |
      | Bob Doe  | bob@findmypast.com | Bob's empty commit   |
      | Jane Doe | jane@example.com   | initial empty commit |

  Scenario: suggest co-authors as text
    Given I cd to "example"
    When I run `git mob coauthors suggest`
    Then the output should contain:
      """
      Here are some suggestions for coauthors based on existing authors of this repository:
      
      git mob add-coauthor AD Amy Doe amy@findmypast.com
      git mob add-coauthor BD Bob Doe bob@findmypast.com
      git mob add-coauthor JD Jane Doe jane@example.com
      
      Paste any line above.

  Scenario: suggest co-authors as a table
    Given I cd to "example"
    When I run `git mob coauthors suggest -otable`
